## Overview
This is a single page application built with React that uses Google Maps & Foursquare APIs to list some of the best places to eat and relax in the Petaluma area.
This project was built for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program.

## Instructions

With this app a user can explore places of interest in the Petaluma area like parks and restaurants.

Once loaded the user can explore the various attractions by:
* Clicking on a marker to see the name and location of the venue.
* Scroll through and select from the list of places in the locations menu.
* Search by typing in the filer locations field.

## Installation
To install this application, the user will need to:

* Download or clone this repository
* In terminal, "cd" into the downloaded or cloned repository
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the server with `npm start`

## Contributing

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on pull requests. 

## Notes
Because React comes with a Serverice Worker built into the package, I simply "registered" the service worker in the index.js according to the instructions.
